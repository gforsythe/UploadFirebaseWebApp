## Backend Calling
Can call from the frontend to the backend to render data. In this case it was calling Firebase's Firestore

## Auth
Using Firebase's Authentication, I am able to give users a log in and their creds go to the secure firestore.

## Upload Files

Using Firebase's Storage users can upload files and progress bar will show progress. Users can pause, resume, and cancel the upload process. Users can also view their uploads with a link.
